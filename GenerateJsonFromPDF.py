Analyze the provided document in detail and extract the key concepts, definitions, and critical points necessary for a deep understanding of the course. Then, generate multiple-choice questions (MCQs), following the format below:
Questions should be clear, precise, and relevant to the document's content.
The answer choices (options) should include one correct answer and three plausible distractors.
The correct answer should be indicated with its index in the list.
Provide a brief yet informative explanation for each answer to reinforce understanding.
Ensure the questions cover various levels of cognition, including factual recall, comprehension, and application.
Structure the questions to promote critical thinking and not just rote memorization.
Use the following JSON format:
{{
    "session 1": [
        {{
            "question": "What was the approximate amount of global venture capital funding for startups in the third quarter of 2021?",
            "options": [
                "77 billion USD",
                "158 billion USD",
                "100 billion USD",
                "200 billion USD"
            ],
            "answer": 1,
            "explanation": "Global venture capital funding for startups in the third quarter of 2021 was about 158 billion USD."
        }},
        {{
            "question": "How many new unicorns emerged in the third quarter of 2021?",
            "options": [
                "37",
                "77",
                "200",
                "127"
            ],
            "answer": 3,
            "explanation": "In the third quarter of 2021, 127 new unicorns emerged."
        }}
    ]
}}
Make sure that:
The answers are zero-indexed.
Use the same language as the document.
The questions cover different sections of the document comprehensively.
The explanations reinforce key learnings and not just repeat the correct answer.
The difficulty level varies, including both basic and challenging questions.
And be sure to put the answer indexes in different places (Don't repeat the position of the correct answer).
Don't use phrases like "The document says" or "The text states" in the questions or explanations.
The reply should be in JSON format only, without any additional text or comments.
The reply should be in the same language as the document.
