  },
  {
    "question": "How can the dead zone in OTDR be avoided?",
    "answer": "By using a launch cable (bobine amorce) before the tested fiber, which allows the OTDR to recover from saturation before reaching the first connector of the test link."

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the effect of pulse width on OTDR measurements?",
    "answer": "Wider pulses: better signal-to-noise ratio, longer range, but lower spatial resolution (cannot distinguish closely spaced events). Narrower pulses: better spatial resolution but lower SNR and shorter range."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the effect of refractive index variation on OTDR distance measurements?",
    "answer": "Distance is calculated as D = T×c/(2n). If the actual refractive index differs from the assumed value, the calculated distance will be incorrect. Higher n gives shorter calculated distance; lower n gives longer calculated distance."

  },
  {
    "question": "Why must FBG operating wavelengths be separated by guard bands?",
    "answer": "To prevent spectral overlap between adjacent FBGs, which would make it impossible to distinguish their individual responses to strain or temperature changes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How would you monitor a structure requiring more arms than can be addressed by a single wavelength range?",
    "answer": "Use multiple interrogation systems with different wavelength ranges, use time-division multiplexing (TDM) in addition to wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), or use spatial multiplexing with multiple fiber lines."

Silica: lower attenuation (~0.2 dB/km), smaller core, requires precision splicing/connectors, higher cost, wider temperature range, longer distances."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the principle of operation for Nd:YAG laser?",
    "answer": "Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet) is a solid-state laser. Nd³⁺ ions in the YAG crystal are optically pumped (typically at 808 nm), exciting electrons to higher energy levels. Population inversion occurs, and stimulated emission produces laser light at 1064 nm (fundamental) or can be frequency-doubled to 532 nm."
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between reflective and non-reflective events on an OTDR trace?",
    "answer": "Reflective events produce sharp spikes and occur at connectors or fiber breaks (Fresnel reflections). Non-reflective events appear as small downward steps and correspond to splices, bends, or microbends with no reflection."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two types of dead zones in OTDR measurements?",
    "answer": "1) Event dead zone: region after a strong reflection where the detector saturates and cannot see nearby events. 2) Attenuation dead zone: region where the OTDR signal recovers to the baseline slope. Both can be reduced using a launch cable (bobine amorce)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between quasi-distributed and fully distributed fiber optic sensors?",
    "answer": "Quasi-distributed sensors (like FBGs) have discrete sensing points, each reflecting a specific wavelength. Fully distributed sensors (Rayleigh, Brillouin, Raman) measure physical parameters continuously along the entire fiber length."
