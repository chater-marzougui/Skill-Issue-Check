        "Drop silently",
        "Generate alerts"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The default action 'Discard' means the firewall will silently drop the packet, effectively denying it without notifying the sender."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of packet filtering rules, what does a 'selector' define?",
      "options": [
        "The action to be taken on a packet.",
        "If there is a rule to apply to the packet.",
        "The source IP address of the packet.",
        "The destination port of the packet."
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "A selector, in packet filtering rules, is a condition that determines whether a specific rule should be applied to a given packet. It checks if the packet's characteristics match the rule's criteria."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following actions can a firewall take based on packet filtering rules?",
      "options": [
        "Erase the packet content.",
        "Allow, discard silently, or reject a packet.",

      "question": "What is the primary disadvantage of stateless packet filtering?",
      "options": [
        "It's too expensive to implement.",
        "It requires very powerful hardware.",
        "It does not save state information, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.",
        "It cannot filter based on IP addresses."
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The main drawback of stateless packet filtering is its lack of state awareness. Since it doesn't track connections, it can be vulnerable to attacks that exploit the lack of context, also Ports > 1024 should be left open if dynamic protocols are in use."
    }
  ],
  "session 1 (p.16-30)": [
    {
      "question": "What is a primary characteristic of a stateless packet filter?",
      "options": [
        "It maintains a connection state table.",
        "It inspects the content of packets.",
        "It does not detect bogus packets out of context.",
        "It always requires user authentication."
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Stateless packet filters operate without awareness of the connection context, making them unable to identify and block packets that are inconsistent with established sessions."
    },

        "Both c2s and s2c",
        "Neither c2s nor s2c"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "When defining security policy rules for stateful firewalls, you primarily consider the Client to Server (c2s) flow. The return Server to Client (s2c) traffic is often automatically allowed, if the c2s flow is allowed by the rule."

  "session 1 (p.31-42)": [
    {
      "question": "What is the primary function of an Application Proxy Firewall's relay operation concerning protocols?",
      "options": [
        "To allow any protocol through port 80 for faster transmission.",
        "To permit only HTTP traffic through port 80, enforcing protocol adherence.",
        "To block all traffic on port 80 to prevent Trojan Horse attacks.",
        "To encrypt all non-HTTP traffic on any port."
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Application Proxy Firewalls enforce protocol adherence by ensuring that if port 80 is used, the traffic must be HTTP. This helps prevent malicious traffic disguised as HTTP."
