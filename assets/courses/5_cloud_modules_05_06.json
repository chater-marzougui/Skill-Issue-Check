      "question": "What is a key benefit of using Dedicated Hosts over other EC2 instance types?",
      "options": [
        "Lower cost compared to On-Demand Instances",
        "Automatic scaling based on demand",
        "Ability to use existing server-bound software licenses",
        "Guaranteed instance availability at all times",
        "Simplified management of underlying hardware"
      ],
      "answer": [
        3
      ],
      "explanation": "Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your existing server-bound software licenses, as the EC2 instance capacity is fully dedicated to your use. This can lead to cost savings compared to purchasing new licenses."

      "question": "Which of the following is a valid use case for On-Demand Instances?",
      "options": [
        "Running applications with flexible start and end times",
        "Development and testing of applications",
        "Long-term, predictable workloads",
        "Applications requiring reserved capacity",
        "Applications only feasible at very low compute prices"
      ],
      "answer": [
        1
      ],
      "explanation": "On-Demand Instances are well-suited for development and testing because they offer flexibility without long-term commitments. Spot Instances are better for applications with flexible start/end times or low price requirements, while Reserved Instances are preferable for long-term, predictable workloads."
