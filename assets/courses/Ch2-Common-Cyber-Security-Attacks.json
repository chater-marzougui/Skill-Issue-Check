        "It's ineffective against encrypted traffic."
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "A limitation of MAC address spoofing is that when the target host sends traffic, the switch will update its MAC address table, correcting the spoofed entry and realigning the MAC address to the original port."

        "Modern firewalls block spoofed IP addresses automatically."
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "When an attacker uses a spoofed IP address, the server sends the SYN|ACK and subsequent datagrams to the spoofed address, making it difficult for the attacker to complete the three-way handshake and establish a TCP connection."

      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "A VLAN double-tagging attack only works when the attacker is connected to a port residing in the same VLAN as the native VLAN of the trunk port because of how switches perform 802.1Q de-encapsulation."

        "It sends an alert to the network administrator."
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "When BPDU Guard is enabled on a port, it immediately puts the switch port in an errdisabled (error-disabled) state upon receiving any BPDU, effectively shutting down the port to prevent STP attacks."

      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The server (Host B) generates the cookie using a hash function over the source and destination IP addresses and port numbers, a coarse time (slowly incrementing timestamp), and a secret number, allowing it to verify the client's ACK later without storing connection state."

      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "While SYN cookies prevent the server from maintaining state for half-open connections, generating and verifying the encrypted responses (cookies) can be computationally expensive. Also, SYN cookies do not reduce the traffic volume of the attack itself, so they are not effective against bandwidth exhaustion."

      ],
      "answer": 2,

      "question": "What is the primary objective of a port scan?",
      "options": [
        "To determine the operating system of a target machine.",
        "To overwhelm a target server with connection requests.",
        "To identify which ports on a target machine are open, closed, or filtered.",
        "To encrypt communication channels between two computers."
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The main goal of a port scan is to discover which ports on a target machine are open, closed, or filtered, which helps attackers identify potential vulnerabilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes what happens when a 'connect scan' finds an open port?",
      "options": [
        "The client receives a SYN/ACK, then sends a RST to terminate the connection.",
        "The client receives an RST/ACK indicating the port is closed.",
        "The server sends a FIN packet to close the connection.",
        "The server ignores the connection request."
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "In a connect scan, when a port is open, the client completes a full TCP handshake (SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK). To avoid establishing a full connection, the scanner sends an RST packet to terminate the connection after receiving the SYN/ACK."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a SYN scan, what action does the scanner take upon receiving a SYN/ACK from the target?",
      "options": [
        "Sends a FIN packet to close the connection.",
        "Sends an ACK to complete the three-way handshake.",
        "Sends an RST packet to terminate the connection.",
        "Sends another SYN packet to the same port."
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Upon receiving a SYN/ACK in a SYN scan, which indicates an open port, the scanner sends an RST packet to reset the connection. This avoids a full TCP connection while still determining the port's status."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is indicated when a packet is dropped during a NULL scan?",
      "options": [
        "The target port is closed.",
        "The target port is filtered.",
        "The target port is open.",
        "The target port is actively in use."
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "In a NULL scan, the absence of a response (packet drop) typically indicates that the target port is open. A closed port usually responds with an RST packet."

        "Flooding the target network with ICMP packets."
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "OS fingerprinting relies on the fact that different operating systems have unique ways of responding to specific TCP packets. By analyzing these responses, the OS can be identified."
    },
    {
      "question": "What distinguishes active stack fingerprinting from passive stack fingerprinting?",
      "options": [
        "Active fingerprinting only captures and analyzes traffic.",
        "Passive fingerprinting sends queries to the target and analyzes the response.",
        "Active fingerprinting sends queries to the target and analyzes the response.",
        "Passive fingerprinting is more easily detected by intrusion detection systems."
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Active stack fingerprinting involves sending queries to the target system and analyzing the response, while passive stack fingerprinting only monitors network traffic without sending any packets to the target."

      "answer": 3,
      "explanation": "A random jammer conserves energy by alternating between sleeping and jamming states, making it more energy-efficient than jammers that constantly emit signals."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following jamming attack types is most difficult to detect?",
      "options": [
        "Constant jammer",

        "Reactive jammer",
        "Random jammer"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "A reactive jammer is harder to detect because it only transmits a signal when it senses channel activity, making it less predictable than other types of jammers."
